# Lunacid Setup Guide
## Requirements

You will need:
- [Archipelago Client](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/tag/0.4.4)
- The .apworld packaged with this mod.
- The mod itself.

## Installation

- Download and unpackage the downloaded mod into your main Lunacid install folder.  Should include LUNACID.exe.
- **LINUX ONLY**: Right click Lunacid in Steam, go to Properties, and in Launch Options put `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp.dll=n,b" %command%`.
- Launch the game at least once, close.
- Install Archipelago Client.  Documentation is [here](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en).
- Once installed, go to where your client is installed, go to custom_worlds, drop the attached .apworld here.
- Run ArchipelagoLauncher, hit Generate Template Settings, in order for the Lunacid.yaml to be generated.

Hosting a game locally is simply taking the Lunacid.yaml file, editing it to suit the settings you want, putting the file in the Players folder, and hitting Generate in ArchipelagoLauncher.  For yaml formatting help, look [here](https://archipelago.gg/tutorial/Archipelago/advanced_settings/en).

## In-game setup

- Create a new save.  The first part of character creation is to login.  After a successful connect, you'll be allowed to make a new character. 
- If successful, all data is saved to a file, found in the base game's folder under ArchSaves.
- Enjoy playing!

## Troubleshooting

* Q: My server's port changed and I can't connect.  How do I fix this?*
**A: Open the .json file for your related save, and change the port in the save directly.**

*Q: I was sent a key to open a door, but it won't open.*
**A: This is now bug report worthy, but short-term, walk to where the item exists, then leave the same area, or reload the area.  If its the talismans, you may have to reopen the chests.**

If you believe you've found a bug or issue with the mod or the apworld, feel free to submit an Issues/Bug Report and let me know.  Appreciated!
