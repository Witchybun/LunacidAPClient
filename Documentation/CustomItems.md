# Lunacid AP Custom Items

This document details the new items Lunacid AP makes and what they do:

## Orb of a Lost Archipelago
This object tells the player what checks in the given area are in logic or not.  It scrambles the list every once in a while, offering the idea of the names "floating in smoke" akin to crystal ball readings.  If the list of locations is too long, it gets truncated.  Either wait, or do the checks you can do, to see more.

## Great Well Doors Keyring
This object tells the player what keys were sent to the player to open doors, meant to help avoid wanting to check /received in the Text Client over this.  Each key is named something somewhat relevant to the door its meant to open.  These are:
